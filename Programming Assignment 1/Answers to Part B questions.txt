1. The methods for the modified Time2 class were much easier to write, took much less time than the original Time2.
2. The modified Time2 class can handle negative values. Additionally, if the added time values wind up being negative, the setter catches this and throws an exception
3. It wouldn't be hard to implement in the original Time2 class, it already accounts for overflow values, it would just need a similar check for underflow. 
		For the modified class, I wasn't thinking of negative values when I implemented the methods, it just worked out that way.
